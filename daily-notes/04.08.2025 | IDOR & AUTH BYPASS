### About Me: ctxzero

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Learning Journey!  
I'm ctxzero — aspiring penetration tester documenting my progress one day at a time.  
This repo contains concise, focused notes on what I’ve practiced, learned, and reflected on.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

### 1. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

- IDOR occurs when applications expose direct references to internal objects (e.g., user IDs) without proper authorization checks.
- By modifying request parameters like `?id=3`, I was able to access other users’ data — a classic IDOR case.
- 🔑 **New Insight:** Some applications **Base64-encode** their parameters (e.g., `id=Mg==`) to appear less obvious — but decoding them often reveals simple, incrementing values (like `1`, `2`, `3`). A reminder: **obfuscation is not security**.

### 2. Authentication Bypass Techniques

Learned and tested various methods to bypass weak authentication mechanisms:

#### 🧪 Bruteforcing

- Tried password bruteforcing against login forms using wordlists.
- Also experimented with **username enumeration** via subtle response differences — often called **fuzzing** or **user enumeration**.

#### 🧠 Logic Flaws

- Explored how flawed logic in login workflows (e.g., skipping verification steps or misordered checks) can allow bypassing login entirely.

#### 🍪 Cookie Tampering

- Practiced editing cookies to impersonate other users.
- Found that some cookies were **MD5 hashed values** (like usernames or IDs) — which are **trivial to reverse** using online hash databases or tools like `hashcat`.
- Key takeaway: **Weak or predictable cookie values = insecure session handling**.

## 🧠 What I Learned Today

- Obfuscated parameters (e.g., Base64) should always be decoded and examined.
- User enumeration and fuzzing are powerful tools to discover valid usernames.
- Cookie manipulation is often overlooked but can be critical in bypassing authentication.
- IDOR vulnerabilities remain simple but impactful — and are common in real-world apps.
