### About Me: ctxzero

Today I expanded my Nmap skills: **basic port scans**, scan order, verbosity, speed, and common options for targeted scanning.  
Knowing these options makes your scans more efficient and controlled.

## üîç Basic Nmap Scan Types

| Scan Type | Command | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| TCP Connect Scan | `nmap -sT MACHINE_IP` | No root required, full TCP handshake |
| TCP SYN Scan | `sudo nmap -sS MACHINE_IP` | ‚ÄúHalf-open‚Äù scan, stealthy, requires root |
| UDP Scan | `sudo nmap -sU MACHINE_IP` | Unreliable due to UDP behavior |

> These scan types help you discover running TCP and UDP services on a target host.

## üîç Common Nmap Options

| Option | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `-p-` | Scan all ports |
| `-p1-1023` | Scan ports 1 to 1023 |
| `-F` | Scan 100 most common ports |
| `-r` | Scan ports in consecutive order (no randomization) |
| `-v` | Verbose output ‚Üí see scan progress/details |
| `-T0` to `-T5` | Scan timing templates: T0 = slowest, T5 = fastest |
| `--max-rate 50` | Limit packets/sec ‚â§ 50 |
| `--min-rate 15` | Minimum packets/sec ‚â• 15 |
| `--min-parallelism 100` | At least 100 probes in parallel |

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- Use **`-r`** to scan ports in order ‚Üí easier to track  
- **`-v`** gives feedback during scan ‚Üí good for long scans  
- **Timing templates (-T0 to -T5)** balance speed vs. stealth  
- **Port ranges (-p)** let you target specific or all ports  
- **Rate limits and parallelism** help avoid overwhelming networks or triggering IDS
