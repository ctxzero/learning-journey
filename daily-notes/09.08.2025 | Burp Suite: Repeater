### About Me: ctxzero

Today I worked with **Burp Suite Repeater**.  
It’s super handy for pentesting because you can **take any request you captured in Proxy and resend it multiple times**, tweak stuff, and see how the server reacts.

---

## 🔍 Key Points

- **Resend requests:** Capture a request in Burp Proxy and send it to Repeater.  
- **Modify parameters:** Change GET/POST data, headers, cookies, etc.  
- **Observe responses:** Check status codes, output, or errors to see how the server handles your input.  
- **Test manually:** Perfect for SQLi, XSS, Command Injection, authentication bypasses.  
- **Iterate quickly:** Small tweaks, repeated requests, fast learning.

---

### Practical Tips

- Always start with the request exactly as it was captured, then change one thing at a time.  
- Keep an eye on response differences — even small changes can reveal vulnerabilities.  
- Use it alongside Burp Proxy for live capture or Intruder for fuzzing later.

### Key Takeaways

- Repeater = your manual playground for web requests.  
- Send → change → observe → repeat.  
- Helps you **understand how the server reacts** to different inputs.  
- Essential for hands-on pentesting practice.
